# Instructions

This directory holds guides for various tools / environments that will be used throughout the course. They may make most sense to read in the order they are numbered, but also hold some cross-references to each other.

### 1 - Environment setup

Here you will find instructions on how to setup the environment that will be used during the course. The instructions here apply to both your local computer and the cloud virtual machine that will be used in the later stages.

### 2-3 - Cloud instructions

We will provide instructions for how to run your code using cloud GPUs as HA1 approaches.

### 4 - Keep git repo in sync

During the course, the GitHub repository is expected to be updated many times, for various reasons, e.g.
- Updating instructions
- Posting new assignments
- Updating already released assignments (we will do our best to avoid it, but at times it may be necessary for us to do this)

Here you can find instructions on how to best keep in sync with the latest update and what to do if you encounter any problems.
